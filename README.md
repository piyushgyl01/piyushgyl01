# Hey, I'm Piyush Goyal 👋

**SOFTWARE ENGINEER CUM DESIGNER**

**Obsessed with design & code *plus everything in between***

I don't care about titles or positions. I just want to build software and that's it. To make that happen I'll learn everything and anything. Because the impact software had on me [both constructively & destructively] is insane, which just makes me pumped up and I just end up wanting to do the same for other people.

## 🛠️ My Stack
**Without them I don't *feel alive***

Though I believe that having better or worse tools doesn't make any difference. Because if you ask me, the one who's wielding them makes or breaks the game.
